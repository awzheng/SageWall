## TL;DR

- Designed and deployed a **serverless ML pipeline** on AWS (S3, Lambda, SageMaker, SNS) to detect network intrusions in real-time
- Trained an **XGBoost binary classifier** on 125,000+ NSL-KDD records, achieving **99.9% accuracy** with **<100ms inference latency**
- Built an **ETL pipeline** using AWS Lambda and Pandas to preprocess raw network logs (one-hot encoding, feature engineering, schema validation)
- Developed a **Streamlit web application** for real-time threat visualization and integrated **AWS SNS** for automated alerting on high-confidence detections
- Resolved production issues including Lambda memory optimization (128MB to 1024MB) and data type compatibility bugs in the ML pipeline

> My first cloud engineering + ML project! Built this over winter break to teach myself AWS and machine learning. It detects network attacks (DoS, Probe, R2L, U2R) in real-time using XGBoost on SageMaker.

---

## What Is This?

Traditional firewalls use static rules, so they only catch attacks they already know about. SageWall uses **machine learning** to learn what "normal" network traffic looks like, so it can detect *new* attacks based on statistical anomalies.

Think of it like this: instead of memorizing every burglar's face, you learn what normal foot traffic looks like and flag anything weird.

## Features

- **Streamlit Web App:** Clean UI to paste packet data and get instant threat predictions
- **Real-time Inference:** SageMaker endpoint responds in <100ms
- **SNS Alerting:** Sends email/SMS when threat confidence exceeds 90%
- **Fully Serverless:** No servers to manage; Lambda + SageMaker handle everything
- **Literate Notebook:** The training notebook reads like a tutorial, not just code

|--------|-------|
| **Accuracy** | 99.9% on validation set |
| **Inference Latency** | <100ms per packet |
| **Dataset** | NSL-KDD (125,000+ records) |

Sample output from the validation test:

```
Packet #1: Real=ATTACK | AI Confidence=0.9999 -> ✅ CAUGHT
Packet #2: Real=ATTACK | AI Confidence=0.9998 -> ✅ CAUGHT  
Packet #3: Real=ATTACK | AI Confidence=0.9999 -> ✅ CAUGHT
Packet #4: Real=Normal | AI Confidence=0.0003 -> ✅ CLEARED
Packet #5: Real=ATTACK | AI Confidence=0.9998 -> ✅ CAUGHT
```

## Challenges I Ran Into (and Fixed!)

### 1. Lambda Kept Timing Out

**What happened:** Default Lambda memory (128MB) wasn't enough to run Pandas on the dataset. It would just... die.

**The fix:** Bumped memory to 1024MB. Turns out Lambda scales CPU proportionally with RAM, so this also made it way faster.

```
# Before: TIMEOUT at 128 MB
# After:  12.8 seconds at 1024 MB, only used 506 MB ✓
```

### 2. XGBoost Hated My Data Types

**What happened:** `pd.get_dummies()` outputs `True`/`False` by default. XGBoost only accepts numbers and would crash during training with a cryptic error.

**The fix:** Force integer output and then cast everything to floats:

```python
df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=CATEGORICAL_COLUMNS, dtype=int)
df = df.astype(float)  # belt and suspenders
```

### 3. boto3 Wouldn't Load on macOS

**What happened:** Running `streamlit run app.py` locally on my Mac threw a weird permissions error when importing boto3 at startup.

**The fix:** Moved the `import boto3` inside the function that actually needs it. Lazy loading FTW.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- AWS Account with SageMaker access
- Python 3.11
- AWS CLI configured (`aws configure`)

### Run the Streamlit App

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/awzheng/SageWall.git
cd SageWall

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
streamlit run app.py
```

### Full Deployment

1. **Deploy Lambda** with the `AWSSDKPandas` layer and 1024MB memory
2. **Configure S3 trigger** to run Lambda on new uploads to your raw bucket
3. **Run the notebook** in SageMaker Studio to train and deploy the endpoint
4. **Connect the Streamlit app** by entering your endpoint name in the sidebar

Check the notebook (`SageWall_Training.ipynb`) for detailed step-by-step instructions. I wrote it like a tutorial so it's easy to follow.

## Dataset

**NSL-KDD:** The standard benchmark for intrusion detection research.

- 125,973 training records
- 41 features, 122 after one-hot encoding
- 5 classes: Normal, DoS, Probe, R2L, U2R

---

## What's Next

- [ ] Add automated testing with pytest
- [ ] Deploy Streamlit app to AWS (EC2 or App Runner)
- [ ] Add confusion matrix visualization
- [ ] Try other models (Random Forest, Neural Net) for comparison

## About Me

**Andrew Zheng**  
1B Electrical & Computer Engineering  
University of Waterloo

This was my first real cloud/ML project. Built it over winter break 2025 to learn AWS and get hands-on with machine learning. Definitely learned a lot about debugging Lambda timeouts at 2am.

Feel free to reach out if you have questions or suggestions!
